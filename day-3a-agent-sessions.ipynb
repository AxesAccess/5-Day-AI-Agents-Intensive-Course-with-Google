      "User > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, there are **constant and significant new developments in AI-driven drug discovery**. This is one of the most dynamic and promising areas where AI is making a real impact. Here's a breakdown of some of the key new developments and trends:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Beyond Prediction, Towards Creation:** While earlier AI focused on analyzing existing compounds, generative AI (like GANs and VAEs) is now being used to *design entirely new molecules* with desired properties from scratch. This means AI can propose molecules that humans might not have conceived of.\n",
      "*   **Targeted Design:** Generative models are being trained to create molecules that are predicted to bind to specific disease targets, have favorable pharmacokinetic profiles (how the body absorbs, distributes, metabolizes, and excretes a drug), and are less likely to cause toxicity.\n",
      "*   **Examples:** Companies are using these approaches to design novel antibiotics, antivirals, and cancer therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Enhanced Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Uncovering Hidden Pathways:** AI can analyze massive amounts of genomic, proteomic, and clinical data to identify novel disease targets that were previously unknown or poorly understood.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Target Druggability:** AI models are getting better at predicting whether a newly identified target is \"druggable\" – meaning a molecule can be designed to effectively interact with it.\n",
      "*   **Systems Biology Approach:** AI is enabling a more holistic understanding of disease by integrating data from various biological systems, leading to the identification of more complex and effective drug targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Accelerating Pre-clinical Testing and Optimization:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **In Silico Screening:** AI can rapidly screen millions of potential drug candidates against a target *in silico* (using computer simulations), significantly reducing the need for expensive and time-consuming laboratory experiments.\n",
      "*   **Predicting Efficacy and Toxicity:** Advanced AI models can predict the likely efficacy and potential toxicity of drug candidates with greater accuracy, helping to de-risk compounds early in the process.\n",
      "*   **Optimizing Lead Compounds:** AI can help chemists refine promising \"lead\" compounds, suggesting modifications to improve their potency, selectivity, and safety.\n",
      "\n",
      "**4. AI in Protein Structure Prediction:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **AlphaFold and its Successors:** DeepMind's AlphaFold has revolutionized protein structure prediction, providing highly accurate 3D models of proteins. This is crucial because a drug's effectiveness often depends on its ability to bind to a specific protein structure.\n",
      "*   **Drug Design Based on Structure:** Knowing a protein's precise structure allows researchers to design drugs that fit perfectly into its active site, like a key into a lock. AI is being used to leverage these predicted structures for drug design.\n",
      "\n",
      "**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze vast databases of existing drugs and their known effects, alongside disease data, to identify potential new therapeutic uses for already approved medications. This is a faster and often cheaper route to new treatments.\n",
      "*   **De-risking Repurposing:** AI can help identify which existing drugs are most likely to be effective for a new indication, reducing the risk of failure in clinical trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**6. Novel Data Integration and Analysis:**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Multi-omics Data:** AI is essential for integrating and analyzing complex \"multi-omics\" data (genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics) to gain a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and drug responses.\n",
      "*   **Real-World Evidence (RWE):** AI can analyze real-world data from EHRs, wearables, and other sources to understand how drugs perform in diverse patient populations outside of controlled clinical trials.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Key Companies and Initiatives:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Many companies are at the forefront of AI in drug discovery, including:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Pure-play AI Drug Discovery Companies:** Atomwise, BenevolentAI, Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia.\n",
      "*   **Big Pharma Collaborations:** Major pharmaceutical companies are partnering with AI firms or building their own in-house AI capabilities (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, GSK, Merck).\n",
      "*   **Biotech Firms:** Numerous biotech startups are leveraging AI for specific therapeutic areas.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Challenges Remain:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the exciting progress, challenges persist:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Data Quality and Availability:** High-quality, diverse datasets are crucial for training effective AI models.\n",
      "*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions still need rigorous experimental validation, which can be a bottleneck.\n",
      "*   **Regulatory Pathways:** The regulatory framework for AI-designed drugs is still developing.\n",
      "*   **Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a certain prediction can sometimes be difficult (the \"black box\" problem).\n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, AI is no longer just a buzzword in drug discovery; it's a transformative technology fundamentally changing how new medicines are found, designed, and developed, promising to bring safer and more effective treatments to patients faster.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",
      "\n",
      "User > Tell me more about the second development you found.\n",
      "gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **second key development** I mentioned: **Enhanced Target Identification and Validation**. This is a crucial early step in the drug discovery pipeline, and AI is making significant inroads here.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me elaborate on what this means and why it's so important:\n",
      "\n",
      "**What is a \"Drug Target\"?**\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of a disease as a complex machine that's not working correctly. A \"drug target\" is essentially a specific component within that machine (usually a protein, but sometimes a gene or a metabolic pathway) that, if you can modulate its activity, can help fix the problem and alleviate the disease.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Example:** In many cancers, certain proteins become overactive, driving uncontrolled cell growth. These overactive proteins can be drug targets.\n",
      "\n",
      "**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**\n",
      "\n",
      "For decades, identifying new and effective drug targets has been a slow, painstaking process. It often relied on:\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Deep biological expertise:** Scientists meticulously studying diseases and hypothesizing potential targets based on their understanding of cellular processes.\n",
      "*   **Trial and error:** Testing many hypotheses in the lab.\n",
      "*   **Limited data analysis:** The sheer volume of biological data (genomic, proteomic, etc.) was too vast for humans to fully analyze and extract all possible insights.\n",
      "\n",
      "**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, is transforming this by:\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  **Analyzing Massive, Complex Datasets:**\n",
      "    *   **Genomics:** AI can sift through the entire human genome and the genomes of pathogens to identify genes that are uniquely associated with a disease or that play a critical role in its progression.\n",
      "    *   **Proteomics:** It can analyze the proteins expressed by cells under different conditions (healthy vs. diseased) to pinpoint proteins that are over- or under-expressed, or abnormally functioning.\n",
      "    *   **Transcriptomics, Metabolomics, etc.:** AI can integrate data from various \"omics\" layers to build a comprehensive picture of disease at a molecular level.\n",
      "    *   **Literature Mining:** AI can scan millions of scientific papers and patents to identify novel connections and hypotheses about potential targets that human researchers might have missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  **Uncovering Novel Disease Mechanisms:**\n",
      "    *   By analyzing these datasets, AI can reveal previously unknown biological pathways involved in a disease. Targeting a central player in a newly discovered pathway can be more effective than targeting a downstream consequence.\n",
      "    *   It can identify targets that are crucial for disease progression but might not be the most obvious ones.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  **Predicting \"Druggability\":**\n",
      "    *   This is a critical step. Identifying a target is one thing; finding a drug that can effectively bind to and modulate it is another. AI models can predict the likelihood that a particular protein or target is \"druggable.\"\n",
      "    *   They can assess the target's structure (often aided by protein structure prediction tools like AlphaFold), its accessibility, and whether known drug scaffolds are likely to bind to it. This helps researchers prioritize which targets are most promising for drug development.\n",
      "\n",
      "4.  **Validating Targets:**\n",
      "    *   Beyond just identifying a potential target, AI can help validate its role in the disease. By simulating or analyzing experimental data, AI can provide stronger evidence that perturbing this specific target will indeed lead to a therapeutic benefit.\n",
      "    *   It can help predict potential side effects by analyzing the target's role in other biological processes, allowing for early de-risking.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Why is this so Important?**\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Efficiency:** Identifying the *right* target early on saves immense time and resources. Pursuing the wrong target is a major reason why drug candidates fail in later stages.\n",
      "*   **Novelty:** AI can uncover targets that are completely new, leading to the development of first-in-class drugs with potentially groundbreaking efficacy and fewer resistance mechanisms.\n",
      "*   **Precision:** By understanding the specific molecular drivers of a disease, AI-driven target identification can lead to more precise and personalized therapies.\n",
      "\n",
      "**In essence, AI acts like a super-powered biological detective, sifting through mountains of clues (data) to find the most critical points of intervention for a disease.** This significantly accelerates the initial, often most challenging, phase of discovering new medicines.\n",
      "\n",
      " ### Session: compaction_demo\n",

    "Let's explore how to manually manage session state through custom tools. In this example, we'll identify a **transferable characteristic**, like a user's name and their country, and create tools to capture and save it.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why This Example?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The username is a perfect example of information that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is introduced once but referenced multiple times\n",
    "- Should persist throughout a conversation\n",
    "- Represents a user-specific characteristic that enhances personalization\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, for demo purposes, we'll create two tools that can store and retrieve user name and country from the Session State. **Note that all tools have access to the `ToolContext` object.** You don't have to create separate tools for each piece of information you want to share. "
